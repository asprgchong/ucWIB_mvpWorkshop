# Welcome to Women in Business Tech, Marketing, and Entrepreneurship Industry Group

### 1. Forking the repository : Creating a new repo that shares the code and structure of the original "upstream" repo. 
- Forks are used to iterate ideas off of the original repo
- Suggesting changes and implementations to the source code
- Creating a Pull Request to hopefully and eventually merge with the og repo

### 2. Cloning the repository : Creating a copy of the repo displayed in your github repos in order to locally make changes in your IDE of choice before pushing it to your forked repo
- Used to ease fixing of merge conflicts, managing files (add and delete), and pushing large segments of code

With the repo set up, you are now able to add code and work on your very own repository!

Using the intro of HTML, CSS, and Javascript from week 2, create a mockup of your startup idea-- from an informative product website, a webapp for online shopping, or a platform for users to download your propriatary software, all ideas are welcome.

Be creative and have fun :)
